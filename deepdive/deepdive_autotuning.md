Parameter | Description | Default | Autotuning | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
`s_species` | The number of species with which to start the simulations | 1 | If `s_species` is set to `NA` in the config file, this parameter will be drawn from a uniform distribution `U[1, max(d * 5, present_diversity * 2)]` where `d` is the mean range-through diversity through time  | 
`total_sp` | The maximum and minimum number of species permitted in the data set | Autotuned | With `d` set to the number sampled species across time bins, simulations are conditioned to include between `max(d) * 2` and, `sum(d) * 20` | 
`survive_age_condition` | If present diversity is defined as zero (extinct clades), clade will be conditioned to survive until the most recent fossil occurrences | Autotuned for extinct clades | Simulations of extinct clades are conditioned to survive until at least the age of the most recent fossil occurrence | 
`extant_sp` | The minimum and maximum number of permitted extant lineages | Autotuned | If `present_diversity` is defined by the user, then simulated clades are conditioned to reach an extant diversity ranging between `present_diversity / 2` and `present_diversity * 10` | 
`dd_k` | The range of carrying capacity values for clades simulated under diversity-dependent diversification | Autotuned | With `m = mean range-through diversity`, the fraction of simulations performed under a diversity dependent model use a carrying capacity randomly drawn from a uniform distribution:  `U[m / 2, max(m * 5,  present_diversity * 2]` | 
`p_gap` | The probability of having no preservation in a time bin | Autotuned | The parameter `n_gaps` is sampled from a uniform distribution `U[0, p]`, with  `p` indicating the empirical fraction of time bins with no fossil localities. | 
`disp_rate_mean` | The mean of the distribution defining dispersal rates | Autotuned | With `P` defined as the mean proportion of non-endemic taxa through time, this parameter is sampled from a uniform distribution `U[P / 5, P * 5]` | 
`region_mean` | The mean of the distribution defining preservation rates in each geographic region | Autotuned | This is set to the mean of number of localities per region per time bin in empirical data | 
region_variance | The variance of the distribution defining preservation rates in each geographic region | Autotuned | This is set to the variance of number of localities per area in empirical data | 
`sp_mean` | The mean preservation rates allocated to individual species | Autotuned | Let `Q` be an approximation of the empirical sampling rate calculated as `(s - u) / d` where `s` is the number of sampled species, `u` is the number of singletons, and `d` is the range-through diversity. Simulations sample `sp_mean` from a uniform distribution ` U[min(Q) / 2, mean(Q)]` | 
`slope` | The change in the log-linear sampling rate through time | Autotuned | We calculate `a` as the empirical log-linear (negative) slopes in the number of localities through time for each region and sample this parameter in the simulations from a uniform distribution `U[min(slopes) * 2, 0]` | 
`intercept` | The mean simulated number of localities per region at time zero (the present) | Autotuned | We calculate `b` as the empirical log-linear (negative) intercept in the number of localities through time for each region and sample this parameter in the simulations from a uniform distribution  `U[min(b) / 2, max(b) * 2]` | 
`sd_through_time_skyline` | The standard deviation in log sampling rates through time for skyline models (i.e. models where sampling rates varies through time in a piecewise constant fashion) | Autotuned | This parameter is set to the standard deviation of the `log(l +1)`, with `l` being the number of localities per region per time bin calculated from the empirical data | 
`mean_skyline_sampling` | Mean rate, log sampling through time, of skyline models | Autotuned | With `l` being the number of localities per region per time bin, we sample this parameter from a uniform distribution  `U[log(l / 2), log(l * 2)]` | 
`maximum_localities_per_bin` | The maximum number of simulated localities permitted in each time bin | Autotuned | This is set equal to the maximum localities per region per time bin observed in the empirical data | 
`singletons_frequency` | The proportion of singletons | Autotuned | With `u` being the empirical proportion of singletons out of the total sampled species across time  bins, we sample this parameter from a uniform distribution `U[mean(u), max(u)]` | 
`target_n_occs` | Target number of occurrences present in the empirical fossil data, used to degrade simulated fossil records after generation to similar quantity of data as the empirical record | Autotuned | This is set to the total number of occurrences summed across time bins and regions | 
`bin_mean_rates` | The mean number of localities per region through time | Autotuned | This is set to the mean number of localities per region computed for each time bin | 
`bin_std_rates` | The standard deviation of the log number of localities per region through time | Autotuned | With `l` set to the number of localities per region for each time bin, we set this parameter to `2 * log(l + 1)` | 
`locality_rate_multiplier` | A vector of multipliers describing the relative number of localities for each region | Autotuned | For each region this parameter is set to the mean number of localities in the region divided by mean number of localities across all regions | 
`min_n_occurrences` | Minimum number of simulated occurrences | Autotuned | Condition simulations to have at least 10% of the sampled number of empirical occurrences
